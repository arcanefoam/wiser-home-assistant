# Wiser Home integration with Home Assistant by [Kinori Tech](http://knori.tech)

This project provides a custom Home Assistant component for [Wiser Home](https://wiser.draytoncontrols.co.uk/support-getting-started)
multi-zone heating and an accompanying Lovelave Card.

## Requirements

You must be using Wiser [Smart Radiator Thermostats](https://wiser.draytoncontrols.co.uk/smart-radiator-thermostat)
via [zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/WV704R0A0902.html) integration.

You must have a *switch* in Home Assistant that allows control of the `on/off` state of the boiler used in your heating system.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release and unzip it to your preferred location. You will get a `dist` folder; the goodies are inside 😁.  
2. Copy the `custom_compononets` and `www` folders  to your `<home-assistant>\configuration\` folder. Where 
*\<home-assistant\>* is the location of your Home Assistant installation or configuration path.
3. Add a new sensor with the wiser-home platform (see below for details).
4. Restart your Home Assistant service.

**Note:** You don't need the lovelace card for the HA component to work, is just a useful way of monitoring the TRVs and
to use additional features.

## Configuration (wiser-come component)
The component must be added to HA as a sensor (e.g. to your `senor.yaml` file.) using the **wiser_home** platform.
The component allows you to configure the different rooms in your house. Each room can have 1 or more TRVs. Each room
can have its own schedule and/or you can have a general schedule. The structure is as follows:

```yaml
- platform: wiser_home
  unique_id: <id>
  boiler: <boiler switch id>
  rooms:
    <room_name>:
      thermostat:
        - entity_id: <HA TRV id>
      schedule:
        - v: 16
    schedule_append:
      - v: "OFF"
``` 

### Configuration variables
* **unique_id**  \string\>    REQUIRED<br/>Unique id for the component. You can generate a UUID [online](https://www.uuidgenerator.net) (use a Version 4 UUID).
* **bolier**    \<entity.id\>    REQUIRED<br/>Id of the swtich to control the boiler `on/off`
* **rooms**    \<map\>    REQUIRED<br/>Information about the rooms in the house. The *key* is the room name and the
value ifs a room configuration.

  * **room**  \<map\>    REQUIRED<br/>Information about the room.

    * **thermostat** \<map\> REQUIRED (MULTIPLE)<br/>A list of Wiser Home TRV entities installed in the room (i.e. a
    room can have multiple radiators) and their weights.
   
      * **entity_id**  \<climate.id\> REQUIRED<br/>Id of the Wiser Home TRV climate entity
  
      * **weight**  \<number>  OPTIONAL (default 1.0)<br/>Specify how individual values should be weighted when
      calculating the average temperature value for rooms with multiple radiators. Use this value to indicate that
      radiators are of different size and thus, one radiator will have more influence in the room temperature than the
      others. A radiator with a weight of 2 will have a bigger contribution to the room average temperature. The default
      weight is 1, and a weight of 0 causes the value to be excluded completely.
    * **schedule**  \<Schedy\> OPTIONAL<br\>The schedule for the room. Uses the same format as [Schedy](https://hass-apps.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apps/schedy/);
    please refer to their excellent online documentation to learn how to create schedules. [efficiosoft](https://github.com/efficiosoft)
    has done a great job with them! Currently, temperatures can only be specified in °C.
  * **schedule_append**  \<Schedy\> OPTIONAL<br\>The fall-back schedule for all rooms. Uses the same format as [Schedy](https://hass-apps.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apps/schedy/); 

### Example

```yaml
- platform: wiser_home
    unique_id: d6fa37f4-30ca-4bc2-ab8b-f5e96ca2daac
    boiler: switch.el_switch_1_switch
    rooms:
      master:
        thermostat:
          - entity_id: climate.dw_valve_3_climate
        schedule:
          - v: 16  # Room always at 16°C
      living:
        thermostat:
          - entity_id: climate.dw_valve_5_climate
        schedule:
          # Living room at 18°C between Nov-Mar in the night
          - v: 18
            months: 1-3, 11-12  
            rules:
              - { start: "19:00", end: "22:00" }
      kitchen:
        thermostat:
          - entity_id: climate.dw_valve_1_climate
        schedule:
          - v: 20
            months: 1-3, 11-12
            rules:
              - weekdays: 1-5
                rules:
                  - { start: "06:15", end: "07:30" }
                  - { start: "11:45", end: "13:00" }
              - weekdays: 6-7
                rules:
                  - { start: "07:00", end: "09:00" }
    schedule_append:
      # All rooms default to OFF if not in schedule
      - v: "OFF"
```

# Using the lovelace card

Just go to your desired UI page and add a new **Manual Card**. When prompted, provide the correct type: `type: 'custom:wiser-home-card`.
After you have added the card, edit it and select your `wiser_home` component to monitor.

**Note:** The lovelave card is work in progress, so currently it only displays the room information (temp, setpoint,
heat demand) but does not provide any control. 

## Services

The HA component currently offers two services in order to enable and configure away mode:
- Away mode
- Away temp

The away mode service, `wiser_home.set_away_mode`, allows you to Activate/deactivate (true/false) the away mode. When
*active*, the component ignores the schedule of the rooms and sets all valves to the away temp, by default its 16°C.

The away temp service, `wiser_home.set_away_temp`, allows you to change the away temperature. 

You can invoke the services via the UI or, for example, you could use a location automation to set away mode when
everyone leaves the house. 

## Be kind, rewind :)
